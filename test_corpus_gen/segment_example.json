# There will be a 'segments' collection that will contain annotated segments.
# A segment is a union of an arbitrary nubmer of words within one sentence that have to have a single annotation tag. Examples of annotation that segments enable are syntactic dependencies, named entities, and L2 usage errors. A single word may be included in multiple segments.
# The elements of the collection would look like this:

{
  "_id": ...,
  "sent_id": ...,      # ID of the sentence
  "word_ids": [...],   # numbers of words included in the segment (i. e. their indexes in the "words" list)
  "type": "...",       # type of the segment (for now two options are proposed: "dep" (dependency) / "tag")
  "head": ...,         # number of the word which is the head of the dependency (for dependencies)
  "ana": [...]         # list of analyses; each analysis is a number of key-value pairs
}
